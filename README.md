# DataVisualization_HTML_stuffs
This repository is related to the repository DataVisualization.
During the DataVisualization project, at the end, we have an HTML file generated by Rmarkdown. I found it a bit ugly, so I managed to make an aesthetic one.
I've found a template of HTML which is free and legal to use, then I edit file directly in HTML language. 

What I felt later, is that using tools like WordPress might be easier, as I'm not professional at HTML. Still, I enjoy all those time spent on the HTML file, struggling to insert an image.


You can find two folders in this repository :
